# ndarray-meshgrid
Generate a coordinate matrix from a set of bounds and step size.

# example:
```javascript
var meshgrid = require('ndarray-meshgrid');
var arr = meshgrid([-1, 1, 0.2], [0, 10, 1]);
```

`arr` will contain a two dimensional Float32 ndarray with each row containing
interpolated entries dictated by the first argument, and the second entry
from the second argument, and so on. You may pass any number of arrays.
Each array is formatted as: `[lower_bound, upper_bound, step_size]`.

You may also pass a single array of arrays, where each entry is formatted as described above.
