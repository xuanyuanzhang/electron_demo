# ndarray-cartesian-product
Take any number of nd arrays and generate an nd array that is the cartesian product

#example:
```javascript
var ndarray = require('ndarray');
var cartesian = require('narray-cartesian-product');
var a1 = ndarray([0,1]);
var a2 = ndarray([2,3,4]);
var a3 = ndarray([5,6,7,8]);
var ct = cartesian(a1, a2, a3);
```
`ct` will be a new 2d ndarray, where each row contains every possible permutation of an element from each array.

`cartesian` expects the arrays to be 1d, and that each array has an identical format. You cannot, for example, take a cartesian of an ndarray constructed from a `Uint8Array` and a regular javascript `Array`. Any attempt to do so will result in unhappy times.

#Methods:
`cartesian(args)`

Computes the cartesian product from any number of ndarrays. You can either pass any number of ndarrays, or you can pass a single javascript array of ndarrays.
