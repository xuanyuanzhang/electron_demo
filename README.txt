### A Guideline through Electron and Three.js set up ###

1. Install NPM, the package manager for JavaScript and 
   the world's largest software registry.
   Link: https://www.npmjs.com/

2. Install Electron
   With NPM successfully installed:
   - Go to the file directory where your project is
   - run following commands:
	npm init (go through some set up options)
	npm install -g electron
	npm install electron --save
   - After these steps, you will notice some files have been created.

3. Just to play around a little bit with electron, I have a "Hello World"
   demo code pushed on Git.

Also, I highly recommand Webstorm for development.
